0.4 (unreleased)
----------------

- Add boolean HTML attributes per Chameleon 3.8.0.

  All checkboxes, radios, and selects that use boolean HTML attributes
  (selected, checked, etc.) previously used ``literal_false`` and would drop
  any ``False`` value from rendering as an HTML attribute. In Chameleon 3.8.0,
  ``literal_false`` is removed and must instead use ``boolean_attributes`` to
  set defaults.
