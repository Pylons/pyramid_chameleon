0.4 (unreleased)
----------------

- Add boolean HTML attributes per Chameleon 3.8.0.

  All checkboxes, radios, and selects that use boolean HTML attributes
  (selected, checked, etc.) previously used ``literal_false`` and would drop
  any ``False`` value from rendering as an HTML attribute. In Chameleon 3.8.0,
  ``literal_false`` is removed and must instead use ``boolean_attributes`` to
  set defaults.

  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid_chameleon/issues/30

- Add new command ``pyramid-chameleon-precompile``.

- Update the repo to standards.  See
  https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid_chameleon/issues/22

- Remove support for Python 2.6, 2.7, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, and 3.5.
  ``pyramid_chameleon`` now only runs on versions of Python supported by
  Pyramid 2.0 and better.

- Add support for PyPy3.

- Ensure we can build when CHANGES.txt and README.rst cannot be found by
  setup.py.

- Drop reliance on (now non-existent in 2.0) ``pyramid.compat``.

  deprecated in Pyramid > 1.5).

0.2 (2014-02-09)
