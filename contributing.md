## Git Branches

There is a single branch [master](https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid_chameleon/) on which development takes place and from which releases to PyPI are tagged.
This is the default branch on GitHub.


## Prerequisites

Follow the instructions to install Pyramid and the tools needed to build its documentation in [HACKING.txt](https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/blob/master/HACKING.txt).
We will leverage this virtual environment and the tools installed there to build documentation for this project.
This has several advantages:

* You don't have to install Sphinx and its dependencies another time.
* You are encouraged to contribute to the official documentation.
* No increased maintenance for the Pylons Project.
